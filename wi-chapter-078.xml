The motor vehicle fuel tax is to be computed and paid as provided in this chapter.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a person who receives motor vehicle fuel under s.78.07shall collect from the purchaser of the motor vehicle fuel that is received, and the purchaser shall pay to the person who receives the motor vehicle fuel under s.78.07, the tax imposed by this section on each sale of motor vehicle fuel at the time of the sale, irrespective of whether the sale is for cash or on credit.  In each subsequent sale or distribution of motor vehicle fuel on which the tax has been collected as provided in this subsection, the tax collected shall be added to the selling price so that the tax is paid ultimately by the user of the motor vehicle fuel.</p>

              <p>78.12(5)  Payment of tax.  Licensed suppliers shall pay taxes on motor vehicle fuel no later than the 15th day of the month for motor vehicle fuel sold during the previous month.  At the option of a wholesaler distributor, a licensed supplier shall allow the wholesaler distributor to delay paying the tax to the licensed supplier until the date that the tax is due to this state.  A wholesaler distributor who makes delayed payments shall make the payments by electronic funds transfer.  If a wholesaler distributor fails to make timely payments, the licensed supplier may terminate the right of the wholesaler distributor to make delayed payments.  Each licensed supplier shall notify the department of each wholesaler distributor who makes delayed payments of the tax.  The department may require any wholesaler distributor who makes delayed payments of the tax to furnish the department a surety bond payable to this state in an amount not to exceed 3 times the highest estimated monthly tax owed by the wholesaler distributor.  Whenever the wholesaler distributor pays the licensed supplier, the licensed supplier shall credit the wholesaler distributor’s account for the amount of tax reduction that results from the calculation under s.78.12 (4) (a) 2.</p>

              <p>78.65(1)  If a general aviation fuel licensee or licensee under s.78.09or78.47violates any provision of this chapter and the department deems good cause exists for suspension or revocation by reason of such violation, the department may suspend such person’s license, or, after a hearing of the charges is held, it may revoke such license.  The department may not suspend a license unless the department has notified the holder of the license of a hearing to be held on the charges, and the department may not revoke a license until after the department has notified the holder of the license of a hearing and has afforded the holder an opportunity to appear and testify.  The department shall notify the licensee in writing of the time and place a hearing of the charges shall be held.  The notice shall contain a statement of the alleged violation and shall be served upon the licensee at least 10 days prior to the hearing.  At the time and place fixed in the notice, the department shall proceed to a hearing of the charges and shall afford the licensee an opportunity to present in person or by counsel statements, testimony, evidence, and argument pertinent to the charges or to any defense thereto.  The department may continue the hearing from time to time but not more than 60 days.  After the hearing, the department shall rescind the order of suspension, if any, and for good cause shown shall either suspend the license for a period of time or revoke the license.</p>
