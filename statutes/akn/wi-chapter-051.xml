In counties having a population of less than 750,000, the law enforcement officer or other person authorized to take a child into custody under ch.48or to take a juvenile into custody under ch.938shall sign a statement of emergency detention that shall provide detailed specific information concerning the recent overt act, attempt, or threat to act or omission on which the belief under sub.(1)is based and the names of persons observing or reporting the recent overt act, attempt, or threat to act or omission.  The law enforcement officer or other person is not required to designate in the statement whether the subject individual is mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or drug dependent, but shall allege that he or she has cause to believe that the individual evidences one or more of these conditions.  The statement of emergency detention shall be filed by the officer or other person with the detention facility at the time of admission, and with the court immediately thereafter.  The filing of the statement has the same effect as a petition for commitment under s.51.20.  When, upon the advice of the treatment staff, the director of a facility specified in sub.(2) (d)determines that the grounds for detention no longer exist, he or she shall discharge the individual detained under this section.  Unless a hearing is held under s.51.20 (7)or55.135, the subject individual may not be detained by the law enforcement officer or other person and the facility for more than a total of 72 hours after the individual is taken into custody for the purposes of emergency detention, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.</p>

For purposes of subs.(2)to(9), the requirement of finding probable cause to believe the allegations in sub.(1) (a)or(am)may be satisfied by finding probable cause to believe that the individual satisfies sub.(1) (a) 1.and evidences such impaired judgment, manifested by evidence of a recent act or omission, that there is a substantial probability of physical impairment or injury to himself or herself.  The probability of physical impairment or injury may not be deemed substantial under this subsection if reasonable provision for the individual’s protection is available in the community and there is a reasonable probability that the individual will avail himself or herself of the services or if the individual may be provided protective placement or protective services under ch.55.  The individual’s status as a minor does not automatically establish a substantial probability of physical impairment or injury under this subsection.  Food, shelter or other care provided to an individual who is substantially incapable of obtaining the care for himself or herself, by any person other than a treatment facility, does not constitute reasonable provision for the individual’s protection available in the community under this subsection.</p>

              <p>51.423(2)  From the appropriations under s.20.435 (7) (b)and(o), the department shall distribute the funding for services provided or purchased by county departments under s.46.23,51.42, or51.437to such county departments as provided under s.46.40.  County matching funds are required for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)and(9) (b).  Each county’s required match for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s.46.40 (2)for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s.46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987.  Each county’s required match for the distribution under s.46.40 (9) (b)for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s.46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.)for that year.  Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub.(5).  Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match.  If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds.</p>

The department’s primary responsibility is to guarantee that county departments established under either s.51.42or51.437receive a reasonably uniform minimum level of funding and its secondary responsibility is to fund programs which meet exceptional community needs or provide specialized or innovative services.  Moneys appropriated under s.20.435 (7) (b)and earmarked by the department for mental health services under s.20.435 (7) (o)shall be allocated by the department to county departments under s.51.42or51.437in the manner set forth in this section.</p>

              <p>51.423(2)  From the appropriations under s.20.435 (7) (b)and(o), the department shall distribute the funding for services provided or purchased by county departments under s.46.23,51.42, or51.437to such county departments as provided under s.46.40.  County matching funds are required for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)and(9) (b).  Each county’s required match for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s.46.40 (2)for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s.46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987.  Each county’s required match for the distribution under s.46.40 (9) (b)for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s.46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.)for that year.  Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub.(5).  Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match.  If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds.</p>

County matching funds are required for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)and(9) (b).  Each county’s required match for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s.46.40 (2)for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s.46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987.  Each county’s required match for the distribution under s.46.40 (9) (b)for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s.46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.)for that year.  Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub.(5).  Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match.  If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds.</p>

              <p>51.423(2)  From the appropriations under s.20.435 (7) (b)and(o), the department shall distribute the funding for services provided or purchased by county departments under s.46.23,51.42, or51.437to such county departments as provided under s.46.40.  County matching funds are required for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)and(9) (b).  Each county’s required match for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s.46.40 (2)for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s.46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987.  Each county’s required match for the distribution under s.46.40 (9) (b)for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s.46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.)for that year.  Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub.(5).  Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match.  If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds.</p>

County matching funds are required for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)and(9) (b).  Each county’s required match for the distributions under s.46.40 (2)for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s.46.40 (2)for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s.46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987.  Each county’s required match for the distribution under s.46.40 (9) (b)for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s.46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.)for that year.  Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub.(5).  Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match.  If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds.</p>

              <p>51.75(1)  Article I. The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families and society as a whole.  Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them.  Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.</p>
