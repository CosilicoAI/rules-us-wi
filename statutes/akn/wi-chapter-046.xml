Under such an agreement, in the interest of improved service coordination and effectiveness, the county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department, the Milwaukee County mental health board, as applicable, or county boards of supervisors in counties with a multicounty department may reallocate among county departments under ss.46.215,46.22,46.23,51.42, and51.437funds that otherwise would be specified for use by a single county department.  The budget under s.46.031 (1)shall be the vehicle for expressing the proposed use of the single consolidated fund by the county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department, the Milwaukee County mental health board, as applicable, or county boards of supervisors in counties with a multicounty department.  Approval by the department of this use of the fund shall be in the contract under s.46.031 (2g).  Counties that were selected by the department to pilot test consolidated aids for contract periods beginning January 1, 1978, may continue or terminate consolidation with the agreement of the affected county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department, the Milwaukee County mental health board, or county boards of supervisors in counties with a multicounty department.</p>

A county department under s.51.42may refer an adolescent for assessment or treatment under this section and shall approve all admissions to the program under this section of adolescents committed under s.51.20or51.45or admitted under s.51.13.
