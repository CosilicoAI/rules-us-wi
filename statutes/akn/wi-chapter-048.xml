If a petition is filed, the petition may include information received more than 60 days before filing the petition to establish a condition or pattern which, together with information received within the 60-day period, provides a basis for conferring jurisdiction on the court.

If the referral information is a report received by a county department or, in a county having a population of 750,000 or more, the department or a licensed child welfare agency under contract with the department under s.48.981 (3) (a) 1.,2., or2d., that 60-day period shall begin on the day on which the report is received by the county department, department, or licensed child welfare agency.  If the case is closed or an informal disposition is entered into, the district attorney, corporation counsel, or other official under s.48.09shall receive written notice of that action.  If a law enforcement officer has made a recommendation concerning the child, or the unborn child and the expectant mother of the unborn child, the intake worker shall forward this recommendation to the district attorney, corporation counsel, or other official under s.48.09.  If a petition is filed, the petition may include information received more than 60 days before filing the petition to establish a condition or pattern which, together with information received within the 60-day period, provides a basis for conferring jurisdiction on the court.  The court shall grant appropriate relief as provided in s.48.315 (3)with respect to any petition that is not referred or filed within the time periods specified in this subsection.  Failure to object to the fact that a petition is not requested within the time period specified in this subsection waives any challenge to the court’s competency to act on the petition.</p>

              <p>48.245(7)  If at any time during the period of informal disposition the intake worker determines that the obligations imposed under it are not being met, the intake worker may cancel the informal disposition.  Within 10 days after the informal disposition is cancelled, the intake worker shall notify the district attorney, corporation counsel, or other official under s.48.09of the cancellation and may request that a petition be filed.  The district attorney, corporation counsel, or other official under s.48.09shall file the petition or close the case within 20 days after the date of the notice.  The petition may include information received before the effective date of the informal disposition, as well as information received during the period of the informal disposition, including information indicating that a party has not met the obligations imposed under the informal disposition, to provide a basis for conferring jurisdiction on the court.  The court shall grant appropriate relief as provided in s.48.315 (3)with respect to any petition that is not filed within the time period specified in this subsection.  Failure to object to the fact that a petition is not filed within the time period specified in this subsection waives any objection to the court’s competency to act on the petition.</p>
