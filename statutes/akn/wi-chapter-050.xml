              <p>50.05(4)  Appointment of receiver. Only the secretary, represented by the department of justice, may apply for a court order appointing the secretary or the secretary’s designee receiver of the facility.  The secretary, as represented, may apply by verified petition to the circuit court for Dane County for the order.  The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within 5 days of the filing of the petition.  The petition and notice of the hearing shall be served on the operator, administrator or designated agent of the facility as provided under ch.801or shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the facility not later than 3 days before the time specified for the hearing, unless a different period is fixed by order of the court.  Notwithstanding ss.803.01to803.09and844.18, the only persons who may appear as a party at a hearing under this subsection or sub.(5)are the secretary or the secretary’s designee and the operator of the facility.  The court shall appoint a receiver for a specified time period requested by the secretary up to 120 days, if it finds that any ground exists which would authorize the appointment of a receiver under sub.(2)and that appointment of a receiver will contribute to the continuity of care or the orderly and safe transfer of residents in the facility.  The court may extend the period of receivership in 30-day increments only on the petition of the department and if the court finds that the department has been unable to transfer all of the residents to another suitable location or the department has determined that it is necessary for the receivership to be extended for the continued health, safety and welfare of the residents.  Notwithstanding s.808.03 (1), any order issued at the hearing on the petition for receivership under this subsection or sub.(5)or at a subsequent hearing concerning matters arising under the receivership or concerning termination of the receivership under sub.(14)may be appealed as a matter of right.</p>

If it appears from the petition filed under sub.(4), or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the petition, or from testimony of witnesses under oath when the court determines that this is necessary, that there is probable cause to believe that an emergency exists in the facility, the court shall immediately issue the requested order for appointment of a receiver, ex parte and without further hearing.  An appearance by the secretary or the secretary’s designee to obtain the order is not a hearing of any preliminary contested matter for the purposes of s.801.58 (1).  Notice of the petition and order shall be served on the operator, administrator, or designated agent of the facility as provided under ch.801or shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the facility within 24 hours after issuance of the order and a hearing on the petition shall be held within 3 days after notice is served or posted unless the operator consents to a later date.  After the hearing, the court may terminate, continue or modify the temporary order.</p>

              <p>50.05(4)  Appointment of receiver. Only the secretary, represented by the department of justice, may apply for a court order appointing the secretary or the secretary’s designee receiver of the facility.  The secretary, as represented, may apply by verified petition to the circuit court for Dane County for the order.  The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within 5 days of the filing of the petition.  The petition and notice of the hearing shall be served on the operator, administrator or designated agent of the facility as provided under ch.801or shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the facility not later than 3 days before the time specified for the hearing, unless a different period is fixed by order of the court.  Notwithstanding ss.803.01to803.09and844.18, the only persons who may appear as a party at a hearing under this subsection or sub.(5)are the secretary or the secretary’s designee and the operator of the facility.  The court shall appoint a receiver for a specified time period requested by the secretary up to 120 days, if it finds that any ground exists which would authorize the appointment of a receiver under sub.(2)and that appointment of a receiver will contribute to the continuity of care or the orderly and safe transfer of residents in the facility.  The court may extend the period of receivership in 30-day increments only on the petition of the department and if the court finds that the department has been unable to transfer all of the residents to another suitable location or the department has determined that it is necessary for the receivership to be extended for the continued health, safety and welfare of the residents.  Notwithstanding s.808.03 (1), any order issued at the hearing on the petition for receivership under this subsection or sub.(5)or at a subsequent hearing concerning matters arising under the receivership or concerning termination of the receivership under sub.(14)may be appealed as a matter of right.</p>

An appearance by the secretary or the secretary’s designee to obtain the order is not a hearing of any preliminary contested matter for the purposes of s.801.58 (1).  Notice of the petition and order shall be served on the operator, administrator, or designated agent of the facility as provided under ch.801or shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the facility within 24 hours after issuance of the order and a hearing on the petition shall be held within 3 days after notice is served or posted unless the operator consents to a later date.  After the hearing, the court may terminate, continue or modify the temporary order.</p>

If the court terminates a receivership under sub.(14)and the department grants a license for the facility to the same applicant under which the facility was licensed immediately prior to appointment of a receiver under sub.(4)or(5), the court may require that person to post a bond for a period of not less than 120 days in an amount fixed by the court as security for maintaining compliance with this subchapter and the rules promulgated under this subchapter.

The department shall interpret the conditions for Medicare participation for hospitals using guidelines adopted by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services, unless the department determines that a different interpretation is reasonably necessary to protect public health and safety.  The department may promulgate, adopt, amend, and enforce additional rules and standards for the construction, maintenance, and operation of hospitals that the department determines are necessary to provide safe and adequate care and treatment of hospital patients and to protect the health and safety of the patients and employees.  The building codes and construction standards of the department of safety and professional services shall apply to all hospitals to the extent that they are not incompatible with any building codes or construction standards required by the conditions for Medicare participation for hospitals.  Except for the construction codes and standards of the department of safety and professional services and except as provided in s.50.39 (3), the department shall be the sole agency to adopt and enforce rules and standards pertaining to hospitals.</p>
