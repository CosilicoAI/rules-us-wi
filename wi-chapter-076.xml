Notice of such hearing shall be mailed to any company requesting a hearing and shall be published in the official state paper.  Within 30 days after the conclusion of such hearing the department shall enter an order either affirming the state assessment or ordering correction thereof as provided in sub.(2).  A copy of such order shall be sent by certified mail to the company or companies requesting such hearing and to any interested party who has made an appearance in such proceeding.  The department may, on its own motion, correct such state assessment.  Any company having filed application for review of the state assessment pursuant to this section, or any other interested party participating in such hearing, if aggrieved by the order entered by the department, may bring an action in the circuit court for Dane County within 30 days after the entry of such order to have said order set aside and a redetermination made of the state assessment.  In any such action or in any hearing before the department pursuant to this section, any interested party may appear and be heard.  An interested party includes any division of government whose revenues would be affected by any adjustment of the state assessment.</p>

Whenever any sum or part thereof, levied upon any property subject to taxation under ss.76.01to76.26so set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment upon the property, and the reassessment of taxes to that extent shall be deemed to be satisfied.

In case any light, heat or power company fails to make a report as required by sub.(7)within the time required, the department may enter an assessment against that company in a sum representing the approximate amount of the license fees, together with penalties and interest, for which that company may be liable as estimated by the department.  Notice of that assessment shall be given by certified mail, and unless a report conforming to the requirements of this section is filed within 15 days of that notice, that estimated assessment shall become final.  Thereafter the light, heat or power company assessed shall be forever barred from questioning the correctness of the assessment in any action or proceeding.</p>
