Upon receipt of a request under sub.(2), the department of administration shall begin to set off against amounts owed by this state to a vendor taxes owed to this state by that vendor until those taxes are paid in full.

The department of administration shall, within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, transfer to the department of revenue the taxes set off during the previous calendar quarter for deposit in the general fund, or in the transportation fund in respect to taxes owed under ch.78, and shall notify the department of revenue of the amounts set off against each vendor.</p>
