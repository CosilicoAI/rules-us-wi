The owner of an entire quarter quarter section, fractional lot or government lot as determined by U.S. government survey plat, excluding public roads and railroad rights-of-way that may have been sold, may file with the department of natural resources a petition stating that the owner believes the lands therein described are more useful for growing timber and other forest crops than for any other purpose, that the owner intends to practice forestry thereon, that all persons holding encumbrances thereon have joined in the petition and requesting that such lands be approved as “Forest Croplands” under this subchapter.  Whenever any such land is encumbered by a mortgage or other indenture securing any issue of bonds or notes, the trustee named in such mortgage or indenture or any amendment thereto may join in such petition, and such action shall for the purpose of this section be deemed the action of all holders of such bonds or notes.  Land for which a petition is submitted under sub.(4)is exempt from the size requirements specified under this subsection.</p>

              <p>77.04(1)  Tax roll. The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

              <p>77.04(2)  Tax per acre; payment; penalty. The “acreage share” shall be computed at the rate of 10 cents per acre on all lands entered prior to 1972 or entered under s.77.02 (4) (a).  On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

A public hearing under this section shall be held prior to August 1 of each year and the determination of stumpage values made by the department of natural resources shall take effect on November 1 of that year.  If the department of natural resources finds there is a material variance in the stumpage values in the different localities, it may fix separate zones and determine the values for each zone.</p>

              <p>77.04(1)  Tax roll. The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

              <p>77.04(2)  Tax per acre; payment; penalty. The “acreage share” shall be computed at the rate of 10 cents per acre on all lands entered prior to 1972 or entered under s.77.02 (4) (a).  On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

The owner of an entire quarter quarter section, fractional lot or government lot as determined by U.S. government survey plat, excluding public roads and railroad rights-of-way that may have been sold, may file with the department of natural resources a petition stating that the owner believes the lands therein described are more useful for growing timber and other forest crops than for any other purpose, that the owner intends to practice forestry thereon, that all persons holding encumbrances thereon have joined in the petition and requesting that such lands be approved as “Forest Croplands” under this subchapter.  Whenever any such land is encumbered by a mortgage or other indenture securing any issue of bonds or notes, the trustee named in such mortgage or indenture or any amendment thereto may join in such petition, and such action shall for the purpose of this section be deemed the action of all holders of such bonds or notes.

              <p>77.02(2)  Notice of hearing, adjournment. Upon receipt of such petition the department of natural resources shall investigate the same and shall file a listing of descriptions with the town chairperson.  For petitions received prior to May 1, the department shall within the same calendar year cause a notice that such petition has been filed to be published as a class 3 notice, under ch.985, in the newspaper having the largest general circulation in the county in which the lands are located, and notice by registered mail shall be given to the town clerk of any town in which the lands are located.  Such notice shall contain the name of the petitioner, a description of the lands and a statement that any resident of or taxpayer in the town may within 15 days from the date of publication of the notice file a request with the department that it conduct a public hearing on the petition.

              <p>77.04(1)  Tax roll. The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

              <p>77.04(1)  Tax roll. The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

              <p>77.04(2)  Tax per acre; payment; penalty. The “acreage share” shall be computed at the rate of 10 cents per acre on all lands entered prior to 1972 or entered under s.77.02 (4) (a).  On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter.  Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch.70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s.77.10for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s.77.02 (4) (a).  The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub.(2)to establish the annual assessed value of the description.  No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property.</p>

              <p>77.04(2)  Tax per acre; payment; penalty. The “acreage share” shall be computed at the rate of 10 cents per acre on all lands entered prior to 1972 or entered under s.77.02 (4) (a).  On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s.70.32 (2)within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator.  All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31.  If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss.74.11 (11),74.12 (10)and74.47.  These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch.VII of ch. 74shall be issued on them.  After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch.75.  On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.22(1)  There is imposed on the grantor of real estate a real estate transfer fee at the rate of 30 cents for each $100 of value or fraction thereof on every conveyance not exempted or excluded under this subchapter.  In regard to land contracts, the value is the total principal amount that the buyer agrees to pay the seller for the real estate.  This fee shall be collected by the register at the time the instrument of conveyance is submitted for recording.  Except as provided in s.77.255, at the time of submission the grantee or his or her duly authorized agent or other person acquiring an ownership interest under the instrument, or the judgment creditor in the case of a foreclosure under s.846.16, shall execute a return, signed by both grantor and grantee, on the form prescribed under sub.(2).  The register shall enter the fee paid on the face of the deed or other instrument of conveyance before recording, and, except as provided in s.77.255, submission of a completed real estate transfer return and collection by the register of the fee shall be prerequisites to acceptance of the conveyance for recording.  The register shall have no duty to determine either the correct value of the real estate transferred or the validity of any exemption or exclusion claimed.  If the transfer is not subject to a fee as provided in this subchapter, the reason for exemption shall be stated on the face of the conveyance to be recorded by reference to the proper subsection under s.77.25.</p>

              <p>77.61(3m)  A retailer shall use a straight mathematical computation to determine the amount of the tax that the retailer may collect from the retailer’s customers.  The retailer shall calculate the tax amount by combining the applicable tax rates under this subchapter and subch.Vand multiplying the combined tax rate by the sales price or purchase price of each item or invoice, as appropriate.  The retailer shall calculate the tax amount to the 3rd decimal place, disregard tax amounts of less than 0.5 cent, and consider tax amounts of at least 0.5 cent but less than 1 cent to be an additional cent.  The use of a straight mathematical computation, as provided in this subsection, shall not relieve the retailer from liability for payment of the full amount of the tax levied under this subchapter.</p>
